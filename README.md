# Vue3, Vite, and TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for creating Vue3 applications using the Vite build tool and TypeScript language.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/vue3-vite-typescript-boilerplate.git
cd vue3-vite-typescript-boilerplate
npm install`

You can then start the development server:

`npm run dev`

This will start the server at http://localhost:4000.

## Building for Production

To build for production, run:

`npm run build`

This will create a `dist` folder containing the optimized production build.
